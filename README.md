# Pizza Ordering Code Review
------

In this project I have created a page where a user can select the size and toppings of a pizza and submit their order for a final price.

<br/>

### Setup/Installation Instructions
------

You can view this project from my gh-pages website at http://shabis.github.io/Pizza_js/

<br/>

### Known Bugs
------

No known bugs.

<br/>

### Specifications
------

* no size is selected - radio button is setup to select small if no other size is chosen
* no meat option is chosen - drop down will stay on none and no charges will be added
* no toppings are chosen - no additional charges will be added
* nothing is selected before pressing submit - this will automatically select as a small cheese pizza since not toppings were selected.
